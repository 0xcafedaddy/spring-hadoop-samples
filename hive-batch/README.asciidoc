== Hive batch sample

Sample batch application that uses Hive to do a simple Twitter search analysis

=== Building and running

This sample is configured to run with Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 stable release and Hive 0.12.0.

You need to have a Hive server running for this app - see the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted[Hive Wiki]

Quick steps to start Hive server (in a separate terminal window):

    $ cd {dir where hive binary download is extracted}
    $ export HIVE_HOME=`pwd`
    $ export PATH=$HIVE_HOME/bin;$PATH
    $ hive --service hiveserver

Use the following commands to build and run the sample

    $ mvn clean package
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/hiveBatchApp
